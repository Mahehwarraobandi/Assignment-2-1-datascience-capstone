# Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting employee attrition using a deep learning model. The primary goal is to develop a robust model that can identify employees at risk of attrition based on historical data and integrate real-time data for continuous monitoring

# Dataset
Description
Dataset Name: IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance
Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset
Data Description: The dataset contains various features related to employee demographics, job roles, and other relevant attributes. The target variable is Attrition, indicating whether an employee has left the company (1) or not (0).

Data Preprocessing
Label encoding and Feature selection was applied.
Data is split into training and testing sets.
Standardization is applied to the features.

# Model
Overview
A Neural Network model is used for predicting employee attrition. The model is trained on historical data to classify whether an employee is at risk of attrition.

# Results
Accuracy: 85%
Classification Report:
Class 0: Precision = 0.88, Recall = 0.94, F1-Score = 0.91
Class 1: Precision = 0.53, Recall = 0.34, F1-Score = 0.42

# Application to Ongoing Project
This model can be integrated into an HR system to provide real-time predictions of employee attrition. By leveraging the trained model, HR professionals can identify at-risk employees and implement targeted retention strategies.

Adapting the Model
Real-Time Data Integration: Modify the model to accept live data feeds from the organization's HR systems using the real time data api's like LinkedIn, Glassdoor api's etc.
Visual Analytics: Develop interactive dashboards to visualize attrition risks and monitor trends.
NLP Integration: Incorporate NLP techniques to analyze employee feedback and exit interviews to enhance prediction accuracy using twitter api's etc.


# Conclusion
The provided neural network model demonstrates the capability to predict employee attrition with a good level of accuracy. 
Further improvements can be made by addressing class imbalance and exploring more advanced model architectures.
